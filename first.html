    <p>The New 7 Wonders of the World is a contemporary list of seven exceptional structures selected through a global poll orchestrated by the New 7 Wonders Foundation.
        This initiated by Swiss-born Canadian film maker and author Bernard Weber in the year 2000, with the objective of recognizing and celebrating human ingenuity, cultural heritage, and architectural marvels.
        The campaign invited people from all over the world to participate in voting for their favorite landmarks, emphasizing the universal appeal and significance of these sites.
        The voting process culminated on July 7, 2007, in a grand ceremony held in Lisbon, Portugal.
        From an initial pool of over 200 nominated sites, 21 finalists were shortlisted, and eventually, the seven wonders were chosen based on the highest number of votes received.
        These seven wonders span different continents and historical periods, reflecting diverse cultural achievements and  architectural brilliance.
        The selected wonders are the Great Wall of china, Petra in Jordan, Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen Itza in Mexico, the Roman Colosseum in Italy, and the Taj Mahal in India.
        Each of these sites stands as a testament to human creativity, resilience, and the ability to create enduring lagacies that continue to inspire and awe millions of visitors worldwide.
